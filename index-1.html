    <p>Probably, life has been much easier at times, when “coding” meant software development. Today, we realize that tech progress is unstoppable. Big data systems require architects, analysts, developers, QA engineers work together to deliver custom code for us, the software users. The approach to website development has become complex and enterprise-driving with a variety of models to efficiently build the process.

      <h1 class="post-title">WATERFALL</h1>
      <P>The oldest of the models and the best-known. It is the sequence of stages: the output of the first stage serves as input for the next. Meaning the phases don`t overlap, the next step begins only if the previous is ready. This is how software development cycle looks like:
       Requirement specification Design Coding Implementation Integration Software Testing Installation Maintenance Although the model is clear, it is not always useful and flexible as compared to Agile, it works well for the projects with more or less precise requirements. But the IT projects of today are rarely that stable to specify the requirements in advance. They change along with the development process and market growth. Every iteration needs a considerable feedback, QA support, usability strategy. That is why “design before code” principle doesn`t always fit the current dynamics of IT projects. Anyway, Waterfall remains applicable nowadays, so here is how the QA strategy works as per this model:</P>
