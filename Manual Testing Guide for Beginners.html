    <p>Software testing is one of the most essential steps on the way to the project release. There are two primary ways to test an app. One way is done by a program, which is known as automatic testing. Another way is manual testing, meaning that it is processed by a human. While each method has its advantages and disadvantages, their goal is the same: to ensure the quality of the software. Ready to start a tester career? Well, that’s a great idea! You will find useful to check out this article first – it gives an insight into the basics of manual testing not overloading you with unknown and hard technical stuff. So let’s get started.

      <h1 class="post-title">MANUAL TESTING: WHAT IS IT?</h1>
      <p>In short, manual software testing is the process of testing software application features and functions from an end-user perspective. Unlike automated testing, which uses a software program to conduct such tests, manual testing relies on the actions of a human. Typically, a tester follows a set of predetermined cases to ensure consistent processing, reporting on the software performance through manual QA. </p>
