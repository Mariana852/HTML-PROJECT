    <p>This is the stage where the team discusses and analyzes the project requirements â€” the desired way the website/app would be functioning as soon as released. The details of both functional (the software performance) and non-functional (usability, security) requirements are discussed with the project stakeholders and technical managers. In fact, this is a pre-planned stage which serves as a basis for the way the testing process will further develop.

<ul>

  <li>Test Planning</li>
  <p>Most of the articles you might read on the same topic name this stage as the most significant in the whole software testing life cycle. And it does make sense. This is the phase where a team defines the QA strategy along with the cost estimate and efforts determined to test the entire project. QA manager would work on test tool selection, resource planning, role & responsibilities division. As soon as the QA lead gets the results of project load estimate, they come up with the two primary docs: Test Plan and Test Effort Estimation.</p>

  <li>Test Case Development</li>
   <p>This is the stage where the details of test cases are born. In fact, QA engineers not only create but also verify and correct ready test cases and scripts if the new requirements are introduced. Requirement Traceability Matrix, a test case & requirement tracking system, is often a part of the phase.
</p>
  <li>Setting up test environment</li>
   <p>No need to implement the stage as a separate. Test environment defines the conditions (soft- and hardware) for efficient product testing, and it is often completed along with the test case development. Moreover, the QA team doesn`t have to be active here. In such cases, project owner/developers provide ready-made testing environments. The task of QA here is to conduct smoke tests and check if the environment requirements are ready.
</p>
  <li>Test Execution</li>
   <p>An active stage of software testing execution. This is where the plan is carried out. The QA engineers run the tests, document the results, log the defects. They detect bugs, report to the development team for correction, and repeated checks (regression testing).

</ul>
